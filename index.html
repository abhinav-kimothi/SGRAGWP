            <h2>About the Book</h2>
            <p>Generative AI models struggle when you ask them about facts not covered in their training data. Retrieval Augmented Generation—or RAG—enhances an LLM’s available data by adding context from an external knowledge base, so it can answer accurately about proprietary content, recent information, and even live conversations.</p>
            <p>RAG is powerful, and with <strong>A Simple Guide to Retrieval Augmented Generation</strong>, it’s also easy to understand and implement!</p>
            <p>This book makes RAG simple and easy, even if you’ve never worked with LLMs before. It goes deeper than any blog or YouTube tutorial, covering fundamental RAG concepts essential for building LLM-based applications.</p>
            <p>Chapter-by-chapter, you’ll build a complete RAG-enabled system and evaluate its effectiveness. You’ll compare and combine accuracy-improving approaches for different components of RAG, and see what the future holds for RAG.</p>
